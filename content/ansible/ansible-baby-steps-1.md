Summary: Getting started with Ansible

Ansible has become the defacto standard when it comes to server and network
automation.  Why? There is a community behind Ansible.  If you need help there
is support group to help you find your way.  If that isn't enough Redhat will 
sell you a support contract.  

What can you automate with Ansible? Almost everything... There is Ansible
Galaxy(galaxy.ansible.com) where people that have written modules can share
them.  So before creating your own thing check galaxy first.
