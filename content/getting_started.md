Summary: Getting started with the writing 

I need to write more.  There are long periods of time that I don't read much or
write except for work.  This I feel can lead to a lack of creativity.  The path
that I have laid out for myself includes going back to school.  This is going to
require somewhere between a lot and a metric sh!t ton of reading and writing.
This is the reason for this blog, to knock the rust off the old skills.  I have
never been much of a writer.  Matter of fact, Language Arts or in my day English
was one of my worst subjects.  I'm going to change that(Positive Affirmations,
ha ha) 

I love technology.  I love the getting a project working more than than the
project itself.  Does that make sense?  The work to setup and configure things
is more my favorite part of things.  That is what a large part of what the
content will be here.  I want to assemble a collection of articles that are a
little deeper than the "Getting started" articles that you find all over the
web.  

Without further delay, here comes regular content about Linux, Ansible, Python,
and whatever else that comes across my mind.
